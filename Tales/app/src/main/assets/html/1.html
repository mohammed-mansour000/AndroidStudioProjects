        Your first meal of the day is an important one.<br><br>

        According to an article published in Harvard Health Letter, eating breakfast regularly has been linked to a lower risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Starting your day with a healthy meal can help replenish your blood sugar, which your body needs to power your muscles and brain.<br><br>

        Eating a healthy breakfast is especially important on days when exercise is on your agenda. Skipping breakfast can leave you feeling lightheaded or lethargic while you’re working out.<br><br>


        Choosing the right kind of breakfast is crucial. Too many people rely on simple carbohydrates to start their day. A plain white bagel or doughnut won’t keep you feeling full for long.<br><br>


        In comparison, a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast may fend off hunger pangs for longer and provide the energy you need to keep your exercise going.<br><br>


        Follow these tips for eating a healthy breakfast:<br><br>


        <ul align="left" >
            <li><font color="#FF0000">Instead of eating sugar-laden cereals made from refined grains, try oatmeal, oat bran, or other whole-grain cereals that are high in fiber. Then, throw in some protein, such as milk, yogurt, or chopped nuts.</font></li><br><br>
            <li><font color="#FF0000">If you’re making pancakes or waffles, replace some of the all-purpose flour with whole-grain options. Then, stir some cottage cheese into the batter.</font></li><br><br>
            <li><font color="#FF0000">If you prefer toast, choose whole-grain bread. Then pair it with an egg, peanut butter, or another protein source.</font></li><br><br>
